# Overview

This is a first attempt at the javascript programming language.

This project is a todo list program where the user may enter in different tasks and they will be displayed. Afterwards the user may go back to the different tasks and mark them as completed or delete the task entirely.

I wrote this mainly to get familiarized with the language and because I wanted something that I thought could be useful to use.

# Development Environment

To make this program I used mainly websites on the internet and YouTube tutorials to learn the syntax for the language as well as what to expect to happen when the code ran.

# Useful Websites

I found these websites helpful with learning javascript.

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/default.asp)
- [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript?utm_id=t_kwd-79714989399875:loc-4094:ag_1275434109903582:cp_370314508:n_o:d_c&msclkid=8f589ec24e471c5b3c03f9304342a9da&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US%20-%20Exact&utm_term=introduction%20to%20javascript&utm_content=javascript)

# Future Work

- I need to make it possible to organize the tasks, such as alphabetically.
- I need to make a way to search for specific tasks in the list.
